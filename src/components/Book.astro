                Galen Brelings knows a thing or two about monsters. He’s slain countless on the
                battlefield, and now he wrestles his inner demons as he tries to raise his daughter,
                Mia. Yet nothing prepares him for the monsters he encounters when he takes a job
                investigating a mysterious military black site: rabid beasts that look like wolves
                but walk like men. When the operation goes wrong, it releases the creatures and the
                viral infection they carry. Now, Galen must race to escape the collapse of
                civilization around him. As he struggles to survive, he must protect both himself
                and Mia from not only the darkness that consumes the world...but ultimately, the
                darkness that lurks within himself.

                The nightmares were getting worse. They slithered into Galen’s mind as he laid in
                the darkness, unable to do anything except see what <em>they</em> forced him to see,
                feel what <em>they</em> forced him to feel. It always started in Sanaa, in the Old City,
                on the roof of the casbah overlooking a familiar wasteland of dirt and dead bodies. Galen’s
                left leg was painted crimson red with clusters of thin slashes scattered everywhere from
                his ankle to his groin. Every inch of his body shrieked in pain, and as he sat on the
                rooftop awaiting an extraction, the pain took on a life of its own. It possessed him
                with a singular focus that drowned out all else: he was going to find the people who
                did this to him, and he was going to kill them.
              </p>
              <p class="indent-[5%] mb-0">He was going to make it <em>hurt</em>.</p>
              <p class="indent-[5%] mb-0">
                Galen gripped his Mk 12 rifle with fingertips left cracked and bleeding from the
                arid desert air. Sweat stung his eyes as he peered through his scope, rotated his
                head, and desperately searched for a target somewhere in the clutter of sand and
                wind and fire and corpses. A figure in a balaclava emerged in the distance. Without
                thinking, Galen fired a round. It struck the figure in the head.
              </p>
              <p class="indent-[5%] mb-0">Another emerged, and he shot again.</p>
              <p class="indent-[5%] mb-0">
                It didn’t alleviate his pain. It didn’t make him feel any safer. But it did, for a
                brief moment, scratch the never-ending itch to strike back at the harsh, unforgiving
                world that wished him dead.
